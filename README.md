# 🏨 Hospitality Booking Reconciliation Pipeline

**Interview Demo Project by Mahmud Oyinloye**  
**For: The Agile Monkeys - Data & Analytics Engineer Role**

## 🎯 What This Demonstrates

This project showcases a **real-world GA4 → Salesforce reconciliation pipeline** for a hospitality client, addressing the exact challenges mentioned in the job description:

1. ✅ **Investigating discrepancies** between GA4 and booking data (7-65% gaps)
2. ✅ **Tracing data pipelines** end-to-end to find breakpoints (GCLID tracking)
3. ✅ **Business auditability** (revenue states, attribution accuracy)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Start Airflow

```bash
cd hospitality_booking_reconciliation

# Start Airflow
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for initialization
sleep 30

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 2: Generate Fake Data

```bash
# Access Airflow scheduler container
docker-compose exec airflow-scheduler bash

# Create data directory
mkdir -p /opt/airflow/data

# Generate fake GA4 + Salesforce data
python /opt/airflow/generate_data.py
```

Expected output:
```
================================================================================
DATA GENERATION COMPLETE
================================================================================

📊 BASE BOOKINGS: 500
📊 GA4 EVENTS: 485
📊 SALESFORCE OPPORTUNITIES: 472

💡 EXPECTED DISCREPANCIES:
   - GA4 events with GCLID: ~350
   - SF opportunities with GCLID: ~320
   - Test bookings in GA4: ~10
   - Phone bookings (SF only): ~30
   - Quick cancellations: ~50
```

### Step 3: Access Airflow UI

1. Open browser: http://localhost:8080
2. Login: `airflow` / `airflow`
3. Find DAG: `booking_reconciliation_pipeline`
4. Click "Trigger DAG" (play button)

### Step 4: View Results

Watch the DAG run through 5 tasks:
1. ✅ Extract GA4 events
2. ✅ Extract Salesforce opportunities
3. ✅ Data quality checks
4. ✅ Build reconciliation model
5. ✅ Generate report

- email: 11
```

## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### 1. Pipeline Architecture
> "I built this pipeline using Airflow for orchestration, DuckDB as the data warehouse (simulating Databricks), and implemented a full reconciliation workflow. The DAG has 5 tasks with proper dependency management."

### 2. Data Quality Checks
> "Before reconciliation, I run data quality checks: null transaction IDs, duplicates, and test bookings. This prevents false discrepancies."

### 3. Reconciliation Logic
> "The core query uses a FULL OUTER JOIN to match GA4 events with Salesforce opportunities by transaction_id. I categorize mismatches and analyze GCLID attribution separately."

### 4. Real-World Issues Simulated
- ❌ GCLID lost during payment gateway redirects (10-15% loss rate)
- ❌ Test bookings in GA4 but not Salesforce
- ❌ Phone bookings in Salesforce but not GA4
- ❌ Quick cancellations (booked and cancelled within 1 hour)
- ❌ Timing delays (Salesforce records 5-15 min after GA4)

### 5. Business Impact
> "This reconciliation model answers:
> - What's our true booking-to-attribution match rate? (85-95% is healthy)
> - Which marketing channels have attribution gaps?
> - Are discrepancies systematic (broken tracking) or expected (phone bookings)?"

## 🔍 Key SQL Query (Memorize This!)

```sql
WITH ga4_bookings AS (
  SELECT 
    transaction_id,
    booking_value,
    gclid,
    CASE WHEN user_id = 'test_user' THEN true ELSE false END as is_test
  FROM staging.ga4_events
  WHERE event_name = 'purchase'
),

sf_opportunities AS (
  SELECT
    confirmation_number as transaction_id,
    amount as booking_value,
    gclid__c as gclid,
    booking_source
  FROM staging.salesforce_opportunities
  WHERE stage_name != 'Cancelled'
)

SELECT
  COALESCE(g.transaction_id, s.transaction_id) as transaction_id,
  CASE
    WHEN g.transaction_id IS NOT NULL AND s.transaction_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'matched'
    WHEN g.transaction_id IS NOT NULL AND s.transaction_id IS NULL THEN 'ga4_only'
    WHEN s.transaction_id IS NOT NULL AND g.transaction_id IS NULL THEN 'sf_only'
  END as match_status,
  
  -- GCLID attribution analysis
  CASE
    WHEN g.gclid IS NOT NULL AND s.gclid IS NOT NULL THEN 'attributed'
    WHEN g.gclid IS NOT NULL AND s.gclid IS NULL THEN 'lost_in_sf'
    ELSE 'no_gclid'
  END as gclid_status

FROM ga4_bookings g
FULL OUTER JOIN sf_opportunities s
  ON g.transaction_id = s.transaction_id
```

## 💡 Questions This Project Answers

**Q: "How would you investigate a 30% discrepancy between GA4 and Salesforce?"**  
**A:** "I'd build this exact pipeline:
1. Extract both sources to a data warehouse
2. Run data quality checks (nulls, dupes, test data)
3. Match on transaction ID with FULL OUTER JOIN
4. Categorize unmatched records by likely cause
5. Analyze GCLID attribution separately
6. Present match rate trends over time"

**Q: "How do you trace GCLID through a pipeline?"**  
**A:** "I check each stage:
- GA4 event_params: Is GCLID captured?
- Website forms: Is it in a hidden field?
- Salesforce: Is gclid__c populated?
- Build a monitoring query showing GCLID population rate daily"

**Q: "What's a healthy match rate?"**  
**A:** "85-95% for hospitality, accounting for:
- Phone/walk-in bookings (Salesforce only)
- Test bookings (GA4 only)
- Quick cancellations (GA4 only)
- Payment failures (GA4 only)"

## 🎤 Interview Prep

**Practice explaining this in 3 minutes:**

"This is a hospitality booking reconciliation pipeline I built to demonstrate how I'd investigate GA4 vs Salesforce discrepancies.

**Architecture:** Airflow orchestrates the ETL, extracting from simulated GA4 events and Salesforce opportunities into DuckDB (standing in for Databricks). 

**Pipeline:** 5 tasks - extract both sources, run data quality checks, build reconciliation model with FULL OUTER JOIN on transaction ID, and generate a stakeholder-friendly report.

**Real Issues Simulated:** GCLID loss during payment redirects, test bookings, phone reservations, quick cancellations.

**Results:** Achieves 85% match rate with clear categorization of the 15% discrepancies - most are expected (phone bookings, test data), only ~2% are actual tracking bugs.

**Business Value:** This gives the client confidence in their attribution data and pinpoints where to fix tracking vs. what's normal variance."

## 🧹 Cleanup

```bash
# Stop Airflow
docker-compose down

# Remove volumes (optional - clears all data)
docker-compose down -v
```
