## üö® COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

‚ùå **Don't:** Jump straight into technical details without asking clarifying questions  
‚úÖ **Do:** "Before I answer, can I clarify the time period and data sources?"

‚ùå **Don't:** Say "I don't have experience with X"  
‚úÖ **Do:** "I haven't used X specifically, but I've used Y which is similar. I can ramp up quickly."

‚ùå **Don't:** Apologize for not knowing everything  
‚úÖ **Do:** Show how you'd figure it out: "I'd start by checking the documentation and running a test query..."

‚ùå **Don't:** Over-complicate answers  
‚úÖ **Do:** KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - start broad, then add detail if asked
